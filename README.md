# Addicted2Captcha
This plugin was created to prevent possible bot spam on Minecraft servers. The first time a player joins the server, they will receive a captcha verification by writing a random generated code in order to unlock the chat.

Commands:

/ addicted2 reset - lock the chat for a specific player, resolving the captcha again

/ addicted2 verify - saves a specific player from solving the captcha
