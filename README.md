# ServerCaptcha
This plugin was created to prevent possible bot spam on Game servers. The first time a player joins the server, they will receive a captcha verification by writing a random generated code in order to unlock the chat.

Commands:

/captcha reset - lock the chat for a specific player, resolving the captcha again

/captcha verify - saves a specific player from solving the captcha
